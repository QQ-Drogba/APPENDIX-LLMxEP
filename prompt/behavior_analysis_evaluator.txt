# Task
You are an analyst of household electricity usage. Your task is to rate the factuality, logicality, and coverage of the **Behavior Analysis Result** based on the **Provided User Information**.

# Evaluation Criteria
- Factuality (0-10): Based on the provided user information, evaluate how well the description in the Behavior Analysis Result matches the objective facts.
- Logicality (0-10): Based on the provided user information and common sense, evaluate how reasonable is the description in the Behavior Analysis Result.
- Expressiveness (0-10): Based on the provided information, evaluate each item in the Behavior Analysis Result for clarity and the depth of insight into Behavior, rather than just factual description.
- Coverage (0-10): For each relationship in the provided user information, evaluate how thoroughly the Behavior Analysis Result reflects.

# Evaluation Steps for Each Point of the Behavior Analysis Result
1. Analyze the meaning of each point in the **Behavior Analysis Result**.
2. Fully read the **Provided User Information** and find the corresponding information for each point in the **Behavior Analysis Result**.
3. For each point in the **Behavior Analysis Result**, assign a score from 0 (not at all) to 10 (very well) for Factuality, Expressiveness and Logicality based on the evaluation criteria.
4. For each relationship in the **Provided User Information**, assign a score from 0 (not at all) to 10 (very well) for Coverage based on the evaluation criteria.

# **JSON Output Format**
The output should be a **JSON** containing the following fields:
- `Factuality`: A dictionary where each key is the index (`idx`) of the point in **Behavior Analysis Result**, and the value is the factuality score (0-10).
- `Logicality`: A dictionary where each key is the index (`idx`) of the point in **Behavior Analysis Result**, and the value is the logicality score (0-10).
- `Expressiveness`: A dictionary where each key is the index (`idx`) of the point in **Behavior Analysis Result**, and the value is the expressiveness score (0-10).
- `Coverage`: A dictionary where each key is the index (`idx`) of the relationship in **Provided User Information**, and the value is the coverage score (0-10).
- Note: Output Json in the specified format **without comments or explanations**.

## Example **JSON** Output:
{{
    "Factuality": {{1: 4, 2: 9, 3: 6, ...}},
    "Logicality": {{1: 3, 2: 6, 3: 8, ...}},
    "Expressiveness": {{1: 5, 2: 4, 3: 6, ...}},
    "Coverage": {{1: 5, 2: 4, 3: 7, ...}}
}}

# Appliance attributes:
- **usage_period**: The appliance may operate during part of these time periods. Each sub-list corresponds to a time period. For example, [18, 22] represents 18:00~22:00.
- **usage_freq**: Average daily usage frequency.

Note: If usage_period covers most of the day, the appliance runs frequently and the value of usage_period as well as usage_freq can be ignored.
