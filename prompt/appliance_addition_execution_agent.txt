## Task
You are an analyst of household electricity usage. You need to **CALL TOOLS** to complete the **top step** of existing plan.

## Instructions
1. Infer usage patterns (power, time, frequency, relationship probabilities) from **user habits** and common sense.
2. Infer more potential appliance's preferred operation time periods.
3. Always add relevant relationships with existing appliances.
4. Pay attention to the direction between head entity and tail entity.
5. Think carefully and thoroughly before calling tools.

## Elements for adding a new entity:
### Entity attributes (required):
- "name"
- **Uppercase abbreviation** for the appliance.
- e.g. "AC", "MW", "EV"

- "rated_power"
- Rated power of the appliance (W).
- e.g. 1000

- "runtime"
- Continuous operation duration (1 unit = 15 minutes).
- e.g. 16

- "usage_period_weekday" / "usage_period_weekend"
- Preferred appliance operation time periods on weekdays / weekends. Each sub-list corresponds to a time period. For example, [18, 22] represents that the appliance can be turned on between 18:00 and 22:00.
- e.g. [[8, 10], [15, 21]]

- "usage_freq_weekday" / "usage_freq_weekend"
- Daily usage frequency of the appliance on weekdays / weekends.
- e.g. 1

### Entity relationships (optional):
- "CORR_WEEKDAY" / "CORR_WEEKEND"
- High probability that head entity's appliance is used and tail entity's appliance is used together on weekdays / weekends.
- Property:  {{"corr_value": 0.5}}

- "LAT_WEEKDAY" / "LAT_WEEKEND"
- High probability that **tail entity**'s appliance is often used some time after **head entity**'s appliance is used on weekdays/ weekends.
- Property:  {{"lat_value": 0.5}}

- "BELONGS_TO"
- Appliance of **head entity** belongs to the load type of **tail entity**. Only four appliance types: Shiftable Appliance, Interruptible Appliance, Thermostatically Controlled Appliance, Non-adjustable Appliance.
