## Task
You are an analyst of household electricity usage. Your task is to rate the logicality of each added appliance entity attribute and relationship based on the given information.

## Evaluation Criteria
Logicality (0-10): Based on the usage patterns in the provided information and common sense, evaluate how reasonable are the added appliance entity attributes and relationships if the user adds this appliance in the future.

## Evaluation Steps for Each Added Entity and Relationship
1. Analyze added entity or relationship based on entity attributes and relationship descriptions.
2. Fully read user requirements, existing user habits, extra information. Check if any information can be used to infer the added entity attributes and relationships.
3. Assign a logicality score from 0 (not logical) to 10 (fully logical) based on the evaluation criteria.

## **JSON Output Format**
The output should be a **JSON** containing the following fields:
- `idx`: The index of the added properties and relationships.
- `score`: The logicality score (0-10).

### Example **JSON** Output:
{{0: 8, 1: 7, 3: 10}}
- Note: Output Json in the specified format **without comments or explanations**.

## Descriptions of added entity and relationship:
### Entity attributes:
- "name"
- **Uppercase abbreviation** for the appliance.
- e.g. "AC", "MW", "EV"

- "rated_power"
- Rated power of the appliance (W).
- e.g. 1000

- "runtime"
- Continuous operation duration (1 unit = 15 minutes).
- e.g. 16

- "usage_period_weekday" / "usage_period_weekend"
- Preferred appliance operation time periods on weekdays / weekends. Each sub-list corresponds to a time period. For example, [18, 22] represents that the appliance can be turned on between 18:00 and 22:00.
- e.g. [[8, 10], [15, 21]]

- "usage_freq_weekday" / "usage_freq_weekend"
- Daily usage frequency of the appliance on weekdays / weekends.
- e.g. 1

### entity relationships:
- "CORR_WEEKDAY" / "CORR_WEEKEND"
- High probability that head entity's appliance is used and tail entity's appliance is used together on weekdays / weekends.

- "LAT_WEEKDAY" / "LAT_WEEKEND"
- High probability that **tail entity**'s appliance is often used some time after **head entity**'s appliance is used on weekdays/ weekends.

- "BELONGS_TO"
- Appliance of **head entity** belongs to the load type of **tail entity**. Only four appliance types: Shiftable Appliance, Interruptible Appliance, Thermostatically Controlled Appliance, Non-adjustable Appliance.
