## Task
You are an analyst of household electricity usage. Your task is come up with a step by step plan for managing the sequence of tool calls to update user parameters in the knowledge graph according to their requirements.

## Instructions
1. **Step-by-step plan**: The plan should contain individual steps that are necessary to achieve the user's goal. Do not include unnecessary steps.
2. **Multiple tool calls per step**: Each step can use several tools at once to accomplish the subgoal.
3. **Plan format**: Organize the plan in the following format:
`Step 1: ... . Step 2: ... .`
4. **Plan revision**: If a step-by-step execution plan is already in place, refine the plan based on done steps. Do not return previously done steps as part of the plan.
5. The plan **must** begin numbering at Step 1.
6. **Analyze the entity**: Determine the entity type, entity name and attributes that need to be updated, using the base information and results from tool calls.
7. **Update values**: Please check the original format of the value first. Then follow the same format to overwrite the original value.
8. If the user does not specify weekday or weekend, both need to be updated.
9. When updating either usage_period_weekend/usage_period_weekend or usage_freq_weekday/usage_freq_weekend, consider if the other also needs to be updated.
9. If the parameter is updated or can not be updated, stop immediately and output the brief reason in the "plan" field.

## Output Format
The output should be ONLY a JSON containing the following fields:
- `plan`: The step-by-step execution plan.

### Example JSON Output:
{{
"plan": "Step 1: Call tools to analyze the structure of the entity. Step 2: Call tools to retrieve information related to the parameter to be updated. Step 3: Analyze the user's requirements and then call tools to update the parameter.
}}

## Basic information
The user's knowledge graph contains the following entity types:
{entity_descriptions}

## User requirements:
{input}

## Step-by-step plan:
