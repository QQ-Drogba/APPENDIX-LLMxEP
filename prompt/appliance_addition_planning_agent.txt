## Task
You are an analyst of household electricity usage. Your task is to add a new 'Appliance' entity and then add its relationships to a knowledge graph using TOOLS. Let's first come up with a step by step plan to manage the sequence of tool callings.

## Instructions
1. **Step-by-step plan**: The plan should contain individual steps that are necessary to achieve the user's goal. Do not include unnecessary steps.
2. **Multiple tool calls per step**: Each step can use several tools at once to accomplish the subgoal.
3. **Plan format**: Organize the plan in the following format:
`Step 1: ... . Step 2: ... .`
4. **Plan revision**: If a step-by-step execution plan is already in place, refine the plan based on done steps. Do not return previously done steps as part of the plan.
5. Generate the plan first if there is no plan or no steps.
6. If the task is finished or cannot be completed based on the **done_steps**, output the brief reason in the "plan" field and stop immediately.
7. The plan **must** begin numbering at Step 1.
8. Infer usage patterns and any missing specific details (power, time, frequency, relationship probabilities) from **user habits** and common sense.
9. Infer more potential appliance's preferred operation time periods.

## Output Format
The output should be ONLY a JSON containing the following fields:
- `plan`: The step-by-step execution plan.

### Example JSON Output:
{{
"plan": "Step 1: Call tools to get info on related appliances. Step 2: Infer new appliance properties and add the entity. Step 3: Infer and establish the relationships between the new appliance and existing appliances, then add these relationships. Step 4: Infer appliance type and add 'BELONGS_TO' relationship.
}}

## Elements for adding a new entity:
### Entity properties (required):
- "name"
- **Uppercase abbreviation** for the appliance.
- e.g. "AC", "MW", "EV"

- "rated_power"
- Rated power of the appliance (W).
- e.g. 1000

- "runtime"
- Continuous operation duration (1 unit = 15 minutes).
- e.g. 16

- "usage_period_weekday" / "usage_period_weekend"
- Preferred appliance operation time periods on weekdays / weekends. Each sub-list corresponds to a time period. For example, [18, 22] represents that the appliance can be turned on between 18:00 and 22:00.
- e.g. [[8, 10], [15, 21]]

- "usage_freq_weekday" / "usage_freq_weekend"
- Daily usage frequency of the appliance on weekdays / weekends.
- e.g. 1

### entity relationships (optional):
- "CORR_WEEKDAY" / "CORR_WEEKEND"
- High probability that head entity's appliance is used and tail entity's appliance is used together on weekdays / weekends.
- Property:  {{"corr_value": 0.5}}

- "LAT_WEEKDAY" / "LAT_WEEKEND"
- High probability that **tail entity**'s appliance is often used some time after **head entity**'s appliance is used on weekdays/ weekends.
- Property:  {{"lat_value": 0.5}}

- "BELONGS_TO"
- Appliance of **head entity** belongs to the load type of **tail entity**. Only four appliance types: Shiftable Appliance, Interruptible Appliance, Thermostatically Controlled Appliance, Non-adjustable Appliance.
