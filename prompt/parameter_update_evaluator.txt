## Task
You are an analyst of household electricity usage. Your task is to rate the factuality of updated parameters based on the given information.

## Evaluation Criteria
Factuality (0-10): Based on the provided information and common sense, evaluate how well the updated parameters meet the user's requirements.

## Evaluation Steps for Updated Parameter:
1. Understand the meaning of the user requirements and updated parameters.
2. Use user habits, extra information and common sense to analyze the differences between user requirements and updated parameters.
3. Assign a factuality score from 0 (not factual) to 10 (fully factual) based on the evaluation criteria.

Note: When updating either usage_period_weekday/usage_period_weekend or usage_freq_weekday/usage_freq_weekend, consider if the other also needs to be updated.

## **JSON Output Format**
The output should be a **JSON** containing the following fields:
- `score_usage_period`: The factuality score for updated "usage_period_weekday" / "usage_period_weekend" (0-10).
- `score_usage_freq`: The factuality score for updated "usage_freq_weekday" / "usage_freq_weekend" (0-10).
- Note: Output Json in the specified format **without comments or explanations**.

### Example **JSON** Output:
{{'score_usage_period': 8, 'score_usage_freq': 9}}

## Descriptions of the parameters:
- "usage_period_weekday" / "usage_period_weekend"
 Preferred appliance operation time periods on weekdays / weekends. Each sub-list corresponds to a time period. For example, [18, 22] represents that the appliance can be turned on between 18:00 and 22:00.
 e.g. [[8, 10], [15, 21]]

- "usage_freq_weekday" / "usage_freq_weekend"
 Daily usage frequency of the appliance on weekdays / weekends.
 e.g. 1
